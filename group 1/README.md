# Mediation-analysis-for-disparity-research

Mediation analysis is used in many fields to differentiate effect between a predictor and an outcome through different middle variables (e.g. mediators or confounders). The R package mmabig is used to perform the mediation anlaysis. The mmabig package takes advantage of the Elastic Net regularized regression in the mediation analysis to identify significant mediators from a large dimension of potential middle variables and make inferences on their effects.

This  project aims at creating an interactive interface for the use of the R package: mmabig. We will then illustrate its use on a real data analysis.
